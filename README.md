# OperaGX-Discord-Nitro

NOTE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK FOR A WHILE, AND I DON'T RECOMMEND USING THIS CODE.

This Python code uses cURL (bash) to make requests.

How to operate:
1. Download Opera GX, as it is a necessity.
2. Head to https://opera.com/gx/discord-nitro.
3. Right-click the page and click Inspect Element.
4. Head to Network
5. Click "CLAIM NOW."
6. Right-click on "direct fulfillment," select copy, and copy as a cURL (bash). Not needed since you only need partnerUserId.
7. Open any text editor and paste the bash code. Look for the partnerUserId, then copy it.
8. Paste it to partnerUserId inside the payload.
9. Run the code.
