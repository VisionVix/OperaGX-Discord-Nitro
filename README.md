# OperaGX-Discord-Nitro

NOTE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK FOR A WHILE AND I DON'T RECOMMEND USING THIS CODE.

This python code is using cURL (bash) to make requests.

How to operate:
1. Download Opera GX as it is a need.
2. Head to https://opera.com/gx/discord-nitro
3. Right click the page and click Inspect Element
4. Head to Network
5. Click "CLAIM NOW"
6. Right clich the "direct-fulfillment", Select copy and copy as cURL (bash) -- Not needed since you only need partnerUserId.
7. Open any text editor and paste the bash code, and look for the partnerUserId then copy it
8. Paste it to partnerUserId inside of payload
9. Run the code
